# What we did

## Sam Avis
I worked on the `10^x` and `e^x` button. I also helped put in the buttons and post requests. I did various thing in the css such as centering everyting, organizing the buttons into divs, and helping to get the result button to make the button GUI a square. I also helped with general debugging and cleaning up the code.

In this lab, I worked on creating the sin, cos and tan functions. We utilized an overarching abstract class Operation, which specified 2 functions, operate and getEquation. From there, we implemented 2 different interfaces--one for one valued equations, and another for 2 valued equations. `sin`, `cos`, and `tan` only take in one value, so they extended the oneValueEquation interface. For styling, I utilized bootstrap to place our calculator into a card class. In addition, I changed each input button to utilize bootstrap's `btn btn-secondary` classes. We standardized all the buttons to be the same size, except for the `Result` button.  I

I worked on the logarithm and natural logarithm classes and functions. In addition, I changed the font of the calculator and also suggested we add a "Result" button, in which the user could get the result of the previous operation and automatically put it into the first number.

## Yanshen Lin
I worked on the `Square root`, `x^2` and `x^y` function in this lab. Also, I did parts of the styling for the whole page to make the calculator look much better. For the function that I created, I am using the `pow` and `sqrt` to get the result based on the user's input.
