Creativity

Yuhao Wang (wangy63)
	- What I make is that I create a speech button. This skill is inspired by a funny game video. Then I search Google for a lot of resources to learn how to create a normal speech button. I also have applied this similar method into our group project. Hope you can enjoy the AI voice, Lol.

	- I add the color border animation around the div tag. Which is changing during the 6s. Enhance the color of the webpage, and you will not be so bored.
	- I also added some css for the button tag. Made it look more funny.

	I generally made the site more colorful. I added the rainbow background as I thought the plain white would be dull. I also added the moving animation to the background. I then added a white border around the text to make it easier to read with the new background. I also changed the color of hovering over the divs from a static color to a random color that keeps changing.
