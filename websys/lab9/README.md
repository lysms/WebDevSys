# Lab 9



# Sam
I created the forms for case 5 and 6 as well as their php requests. I made the format for the post request with the error messaging and the result divs. I helped to debug and spell check as well. I also filled in the part2.txt file.

# Kris
I created the get requests for case 9 and 10 as well as their php requests. I additionally created the js functionality to take in the php database output and create a table based off of the results. The getRequests.php file handles all get requests relevant to the lab (cases 7-10). It queries our lab9 database and converts the results into a json object, which in turn our javascript reads to generate the dynamic tables on the page. I also created the tabs for both the INSERT and SELECT calls we used in the lab.  

# Philip
I wrote the SQL code for inserting the students in part 2. In addtion, I made the implemented the AJAX code in case 7 & 8 from part 2. Finally, I helped getting the tabs to display correctly on the gradebook.php.

# Yanshen
I worked on case 1 & 2 for part 2 and part 3. Working on all functionalities and SQL commands for add fields to the table. In addition, correct some formating error, and work on some additional features as a group. 

# Yuhao
I worked on case 3 & 4 for part 2 and 3. At first I was thinking using the _GET to take over the data but then with the reminder from the team I realize it is better to use _POST directly to update data from the form of the front end.
